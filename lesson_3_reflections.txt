When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When my work needs to be share with other peoples to get more contribution.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To have more control on what gets shared.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches gives the possibility two create locally a new path of modifications without modify the main one. Clones is use to make a copy of remote repository to local repository or to make a copy even locally of a repository. Forks is for clone from remote to remote repository.
